<p>I used it because it provides a customizable and efficient coding environment, and it's more pleasing to my eye</p>

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react)](https://skillicons.dev)
<p>React allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces through its component-based architecture and efficient state management. I used it because it facilitates the development of scalable and maintainable web applications with a large ecosystem of tools and libraries.</p>

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sass)](https://skillicons.dev)
<p>Sass extends the capabilities of CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, which streamline and enhance the styling process. I used it because it allows for more organized, reusable, and maintainable stylesheets, significantly improving workflow efficiency in web development.</p>

<p>I used Figma to see designer thoughts and implement them in the code</p>
